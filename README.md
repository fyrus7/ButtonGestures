Button Gestures Library

This library allows you to use a single push button to be
able to invoke up to 6 different functions.

The button gestures include:

    * No press
    * Single press short (single click)            ---> call func1
    * Single press long  (single click and hold)   ---> call func2
    * Double press short (double click)            ---> call func3
    * Double press long  (double click and hold)   ---> call func4
    * Triple press short (triple click)            ---> call func5
    * Triple press long  (triple click and hold)   ---> call func6

Easy to use. Includes two sample sketches. The first sketch shows how to use the basic functions. The second sketch shows how to register callback functions that will be called for a given gesture.
