Button Gestures Library

This library allows you to use a single push button to be
able to invoke up to 6 different functions.

The button gestures include:

    * No press
    * Single press short (single click)
    * Single press long  (single click and hold)
    * Double press short (double click)
    * Double press long  (double click and hold)
    * Triple press short (triple click)
    * Triple press long  (triple click and hold)

Easy to use. Includes two sample sketches. The first sketch shows how to use the basic functions. The second sketch shows how to register callback functions that will be called for a given gesture.
